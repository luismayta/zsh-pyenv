1. Use the `PATCH` version when introducing backwards compatible bug fixes.

### Backwards compatibility in `0.0.z` and `0.y.z` version

- In the context of initial development, backwards compatibility in versions `0.0.z` is **not guaranteed** when `z` is increased. (Initial development)
- In the context of pre-release, backwards compatibility in versions `0.y.z` is **not guaranteed** when `y` is increased. (Pre-release)
